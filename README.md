### Planned Components (Phases 10-16)

- **controller/** (Phase 10): Process manager, config hot-reload, session tracking, health checks, log aggregation
- **alerts/** (Phase 11): Alert rules engine, notification channels (log/Redis/webhook/email/Slack), alert CLI
- **compliance/** (Phase 12): Audit logger, replay engine, order book reconstruction, regulatory reporting

### Event Flow

1. `apps/md_ingest` streams trades/books via CCXT Pro, deduplicates events, and publishes to Redis topics (`md.trades.*`, `md.book.*`) while journaling to `var/log/njord/`
2. Strategies subscribe to the bus, build signals using injected context (positions, prices, utilities), and emit `OrderIntent` events
3. The risk engine validates intents against kill switches, caps, and policy modules, publishing `risk.decisions` for approved orders
4. Paper trader or live broker services act on decisions, generate fills and position snapshots, and broadcast results back to the bus
5. Portfolio manager tracks fills, executes rebalancing logic, and publishes portfolio snapshots

## Getting Started

1. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   - Update `config/base.yaml` (Redis, exchange, risk limits)
   - Update `config/strategies.yaml` (strategy registry)
   - Update `config/portfolio.yaml` (capital allocation)
   - Keep secrets encrypted in `config/secrets.enc.yaml` (SOPS)

4. **Run services locally:**
   ```bash
   make run-md        # Market data ingestion
   make run-risk      # Risk engine
   make run-paper     # Paper trader
   make run-strat     # Strategy runner
   ```

5. **Inspect logs:**
   - Check `var/log/njord/` for structured NDJSON logs
   - Review journal outputs to validate event flow

6. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   make fmt lint type test  # All guardrails must be green
   ```

## Development Workflow & Guardrails

- **Python 3.11** with `ruff` (format/lint), `mypy --strict`, and `pytest`
- **Guardrails must remain green:**
  ```bash
  make fmt && make lint && make type && make test
  ```
- **Commits:**
  - Follow Conventional Commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
  - Remain â‰¤150 LOC across â‰¤4 files per commit
- **Tests:**
  - Must be deterministic (no network I/O, no long sleeps)
  - Use fixed seeds or injected clocks when needed
  - Golden tests for strategy signal validation
- **Security:**
  - Never bypass kill-switch checks
  - Never commit decrypted secrets
  - Always use SOPS encryption for `config/secrets.enc.yaml`

- **Phase 11:** Alert service with multi-channel notifications (log/Redis/webhook/email/Slack)
- **Phase 12:** Audit service with immutable logging, replay validation, and regulatory exports

## Configuration Files

### Implemented Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config/base.yaml` | Core settings (environment, Redis endpoints, logging, risk limits) |
| `config/strategies.yaml` | Strategy registry and parameterization |
| `config/portfolio.yaml` | Portfolio allocation and rebalancing rules |
| `config/secrets.enc.yaml` | SOPS-encrypted secrets (API keys, credentials) |

### Planned Configuration (Phases 10-12)

- `config/controller.yaml` â€” Service registry and process management settings (Phase 10)
- `config/alerts.yaml` â€” Alert rules and notification channels (Phase 11)
- `config/compliance.yaml` â€” Audit/replay settings, regulatory export templates (Phase 12)

### Configuration Guidelines

- **Live trading** requires explicit flags: `app.env=live` AND `NJORD_ENABLE_LIVE=1`
- **Secrets:** Use `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` syntax for environment variable references
- **SOPS encryption:** Always encrypt secrets at rest, never commit decrypted values
- **Feature gates:** Metrics/alerts/audit gated by env vars (disabled in tests by default)

## Logging & Observability

### Implemented

- **Structured Logging:** `structlog` writes NDJSON entries to `var/log/njord/`
  - Application logs, event journals, error traces
  - Append-only, replayable, machine-parseable
- **Event Journals:** Market data, order intents, risk decisions, fills, positions
- **Kill-Switch Monitoring:**
  - File-based: `/tmp/njord_killswitch` presence trips all services
  - Redis-based: `njord:killswitch` key trips all services
- **Operational Scripts:** Located in `scripts/` for kill-switch control, status checks

### Implemented (Phase 9)

- **Phase 9 â€” Metrics & Telemetry:**
  - Prometheus exporter on `http://localhost:9091/metrics`
  - Comprehensive metric contracts and registry
  - Metric aggregation service with downsampling and persistence
  - Performance attribution engine (Brinson, alpha/beta)

  - YAML-based alert rules engine with deduplication
  - Metrics retention management with automated cleanup and compression
  - Complete telemetry documentation

### Planned (Phases 10-12)

- **Phase 10 â€” Process Control:**
  - `njord-ctl` CLI for start/stop/restart/reload/status/logs/session management
  - Config hot-reload with validation
  - Session tracking and health checks
- **Phase 11 â€” Monitoring & Alerts:**
  - Enhanced alert rules engine, multi-channel notifications
  - Publishes to `var/log/njord/alerts.ndjson` and configured channels
- **Phase 12 â€” Compliance & Audit:**
  - Immutable audit logging, deterministic replay validation
  - Regulatory export utilities, order book reconstruction

## Security & Best Practices

### Secrets Management

- **Environment Variables:** All secrets loaded from env vars
- **Config References:** Use `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` syntax in YAML configs
- **SOPS Encryption:** `config/secrets.enc.yaml` encrypted at rest (never commit decrypted)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Repository contains zero plaintext credentials

### Feature Gating

- **Live Trading:** Requires `app.env=live` in config AND `NJORD_ENABLE_LIVE=1` env var
- **Metrics Emission:** Gated by `NJORD_ENABLE_METRICS=1` (disabled in tests by default)
- **Alert Notifications:** Gated by `NJORD_ENABLE_ALERTS=1` (disabled in tests by default)
- **Audit Logging:** Gated by `NJORD_ENABLE_AUDIT=1` (disabled in tests by default)

### Kill-Switch Enforcement

- **File-Based:** `/tmp/njord_killswitch` (or configurable path) presence trips all services
- **Redis-Based:** `njord:killswitch` key trips all services
- **Process Manager (Planned):** Checks kill-switch before starting live services (refuses if tripped)
- **Alert Integration (Planned):** Critical alerts fire when kill-switch triggered

### Network Security (Implemented Phase 9 / Planned Phases 10-12)

*The following bindings apply to telemetry and planned services (Phases 9-12):*

- **Metrics Exporter (Phase 9):** Binds to `127.0.0.1:9091` by default (Prometheus scraper must be local or tunneled)
- **Metrics Dashboard (Phase 9):** Binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default (web access via SSH tunnel or local browser)
- **Controller API (Phase 10):** Binds to `127.0.0.1:9092` by default (njord-ctl commands local only)
- **Alert Service (Phase 11):** Health check on `127.0.0.1:9093` by default
- **Production Access:** Explicitly set `bind_host` parameter to expose on network interfaces

## Make Targets

### Development

```bash
make help          # Show all available targets
make install       # Create venv and install dependencies
make fmt           # Format code with ruff
make lint          # Lint code with ruff
make type          # Type-check with mypy --strict
make test          # Run pytest test suite
```

### Roadmap Navigation

```bash
make roadmap       # View phase index
make status        # Show current phase status
make next          # Show next planned task
make phase-current # Open current phase file
make phase NUM=8   # Open specific phase file
```

### Polish Backlog Workflow

Pending polish items are tracked alongside the roadmap so they do not get lost:

1. When a sub-phase closes, capture any optional improvements in a short "Polish / Follow-ups" list inside that phase file (e.g. `roadmap/phases/phase-09-telemetry.md`).
2. Mirror those bullets in the global backlog at the end of `ROADMAP_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
3. When the item is addressed (either by a later sub-phase or during Phase 16), remove it from both lists so the backlog stays current.

This keeps polish tasks visible next to their context while providing a single checklist for the Phase 16 optimization sweep.

### Service Execution

```bash
make run-md        # Run market data ingestion
make run-risk      # Run risk engine
make run-paper     # Run paper trader
make run-strat     # Run strategy runner
make run-broker    # Run live broker (dry-run by default)
```

### Kill-Switch Control

```bash
make run-kill-trip  # Trip kill-switch
make run-kill-clear # Clear kill-switch
make check-kill     # Check kill-switch status
```

### Logs & Journals

```bash
make journal       # Tail journal logs
```
